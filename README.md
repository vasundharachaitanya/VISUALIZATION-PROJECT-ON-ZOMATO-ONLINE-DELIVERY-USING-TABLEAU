# VISUALIZATION-PROJECT-ON-ZOMATO-ONLINE-DELIVERY-USING-TABLEAU
This project aims to analyze Zomato's online food delivery data using Tableau. The project will 
explore various aspects of the delivery service, such as customer preferences, popular cuisines,
delivery times, and restaurant ratings. The project will also aim to identify trends and patterns
in the data that can help Zomato optimize its delivery service and improve customer satisfaction. 
The final deliverable will be a set of interactive dashboards that provide insights into the delivery
service's performance and enable stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.
